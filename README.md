# Hello and Welcome
In this repository we provide our results of the Monks problems and AA1 CUP  using our Multilayer Perceptron implementation in C#.NET

We have implemented a lightweight library for building, training and testing multilayer perceptrons. And tested it on the Monks datasets available on https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/MONK's+Problems


### In the project MLPTestDemo.Program.cs
a demo for building, training,saving,loading and testing a MLP
### In AA1_CUP.Screening.cs
a demo for the screening process
### In AA1_CUP.Program.cs
a demo for using the code to perform the regression on the test data
