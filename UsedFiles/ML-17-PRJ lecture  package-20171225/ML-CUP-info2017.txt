******** ML-2017 CUP ************

November 2017   data sets v1


Information:

-) See  Slides of ML-2017 Lecture for the project (with motivation, input format, report hints and rules)

-) In particular consider that the evaluation is computed according to the Mean Euclidean Error 
MEE = (1/N) * sum_p^N(sqrt((output_p,x - target_p,x)^2 + (output_p,y -target_p,y)^2)), 
where N is the number of patterns, p the pattern.

-) Data includes Training set (ML-CUP17-TR.csv) and corresponding Blind Test Set (ML-CUP17-TS.csv)
   Input format: see file prologue.


-) Submission Rules:

- Participation is initially restricted to students of ML course 2017 - University of Pisa.
All participants with their submission agree to the disclosure and publication of their name, results with preliminary and final ranking. 


- Prepare 1 file in standard text format (comma separated values)

team-name_ML-CUP17-TS.csv  

Format of   team-name_ML-CUP17-TS.csv   file:

<begin example file format>

# name of the candidates
# nickname of the team (max 8-10 char) for the results page on the web
# name of the  data set (ML-CUP17) - ML 2017 CUP v1
# date

Table with 315 rows, 3 columns (comma separated values)

Each row is:
id,output_x,output_y
(outputs are real valued localization estimations on the X and Y axis, respectively)

<end example file format>

- A template for the csv file to be delivered is provided in: 
output_template_example-with-random-output-ML-CUP17-TS.csv (which is filled with random-output values for demo)

- Prepare Code package and Report (see Project Lecture slide: please follow general tips, rules and FAQ  
  for the Report therein, including the provided report template file).

- Prepare short abstract (5 lines) with method and validation descriptions:
file name:  team-name_abstract.txt

- Send 1 file csv and 1 abstract file txt (plus the Code package and the Report) to:  micheli@di.unipi.it
  Dealine: see the lecture 1 and the Project Lecture for the exam rules (on the project part).
  EMail Subject: [ML-2017] Report by Mario Rossi …
